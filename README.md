# Hi, I'm Rodrigo 👋

### 🛡️ Aspiring SOC Analyst | Security Automation | Threat Intel

Passionate about Blue Teaming and automating security operations to reduce MTTR (Mean Time to Respond). I focus on building Python-based tools that transform raw data into actionable intelligence.

### 🚀 Featured Project
**[Phishing-Analyzer](https://github.com/freir3r/Phishing-Analyzer)** *Automated Email Triage & Threat Intel Pipeline*
- **The Problem:** Manual triage of `.eml` files is slow and risky.
- **The Solution:** A Python pipeline that extracts IOCs, identifies header anomalies, and performs real-time VirusTotal API lookups.
- **Impact:** Reduces analysis time from minutes to seconds while ensuring analyst safety via URL defanging.

### 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
- **Languages:** Python (Security Scripting), Bash
- **Security Operations:** Phishing Analysis, Log Analysis, IOC Extraction
- **Tools & APIs:** VirusTotal API, EmlParser, Wireshark, Linux/Unix
- **Concepts:** SMTP Headers, Heuristic Detection, Threat Intelligence, Regular Expressions (RegEx)
